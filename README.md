Iframe feedback
========

![Preview](preview/thumbnail.gif)

The concept of iframe feedback is very simple: a web document which shows an iframe with an url pointing to itself. If a script handles when the iframe is inserted in the document, the script can decide the delay between two *frames* (I mean the thing is called an i**frame**, at some point this had to be done). The rendering logic to blend the frames is up to each case.

## What does this "iframe feedback" boilerplate does

* provides a dev environment out-of-the-box (you just launch it with a command and you can expriment with a local server)
* has already a clean starting point with the iframe insertion, as well as a solution to get a frame index using the location of the document

So basically, you follow the installation steps below, and you can play in the `app/index.js` file.


## Some stuff you may want to know

* The html entry point is `index.ejs`. It get turned in time into html code, you don't have to worry about that
